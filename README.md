Front End Web Project

This is my project for Code Louisville 2017 Front End Web Development class
It's a makeshift band website for my band The ProDepressants.
I'm utilizing bootstrap for the photo carousel, some Javascript for an .onclick alert button, and some css media queries for multiple sized devices.
My page's max width cannot go below 380px.
